# SE4003 Spring quarter, 2020
Welcome to your class repository.  Further instructions will be given in class.  This is the readme file, which is actually a part of the repository and can be edited and updated like any other file.  

The readme file is automatically shown at the bottom of a repository's code page, like this one, on GitHub as shown here.  The extention '.md' stands for [_markdown_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is a simplified version of a markup langauge such as the hyper text markup language (HTML).
